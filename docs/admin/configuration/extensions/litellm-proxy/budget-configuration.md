# LiteLLM Budget Configuration

LiteLLM allows you to set spending limits and rate limits through budgets. This guide explains how predefined budgets work in CodeMie and how to customize them via Helm.

## Overview

Budgets in LiteLLM help you control costs and manage API usage by setting:

- **Soft Budget**: Spending threshold in USD that triggers warnings
- **Max Budget**: Hard spending limit in USD that blocks requests when exceeded
- **Budget Duration**: Reset period after which spending counters restart
- **Budget Category**: Logical grouping that determines how the budget is applied

## Budget Types

LiteLLM supports two types of budgets for different use cases – **API Key Budget** and **Predefined Budgets**.

### API Key Budget

This budget is assigned to the specific API key used to integrate CodeMie with LiteLLM.

**Recommended Configuration**: Set to **unlimited** to ensure CodeMie service is never interrupted at the integration level.

:::tip API Key Budget Best Practice
The API key budget should not be the primary cost control mechanism. Instead, use it as a safety net to prevent unexpected issues at the integration layer.
:::

### Predefined Budgets

Predefined budgets are applied automatically to end users based on their usage category (web/API, CLI, or premium models). These are defined in `budgets-config.yaml` and mounted into the CodeMie pod at startup – no manual creation in the LiteLLM UI is required.

:::info Cost Control Strategy
By setting the API key budget to unlimited and configuring predefined budgets per category, you ensure:

- CodeMie service remains available (no integration-level blocking)
- Individual users have controlled spending limits by usage type
- Easy cost management per platform category
  :::

## How Budget Configuration Works

CodeMie uses a `budgets-config.yaml` file to define predefined budgets. This file is mounted into the pod and applied at startup. Budgets are matched to usage by their `budget_category` field.

### Default Platform Budget

By default, the following budget is pre-configured and applied to all end users:

```yaml
predefined_budgets:
  - budget_id: default
    name: Default Budget
    description: Default platform budget for new LiteLLM customers.
    soft_budget: 50.0
    max_budget: 100.0
    budget_duration: 30d
    budget_category: platform
```

## Budget Fields Reference

Each entry in `predefined_budgets` supports the following fields:

| Field             | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `budget_id`       | string | Yes      | Unique identifier used to reference this budget in LiteLLM                                        |
| `name`            | string | Yes      | Human-readable display name                                                                       |
| `description`     | string | No       | Description of the budget's purpose                                                               |
| `soft_budget`     | float  | Yes      | Soft limit in USD that triggers usage warnings                                                    |
| `max_budget`      | float  | Yes      | Hard limit in USD that blocks requests when exceeded                                              |
| `budget_duration` | string | Yes      | Reset period, e.g. `30d` for monthly or `7d` for weekly                                           |
| `budget_category` | string | Yes      | Category that determines how this budget is applied (see [Budget Categories](#budget-categories)) |

## Budget Categories

The `budget_category` field controls which type of usage the budget applies to:

| Category         | Description                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `platform`       | Default web/API usage for end users |
| `cli`            | CodeMie CLI proxy spending          |
| `premium_models` | Costly model spending via CLI       |

## Enabling Budget Enforcement

Budget enforcement is disabled by default. To activate it, set the following environment variables in the CodeMie API deployment:

| Variable                            | Type    | Default | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LLM_PROXY_BUDGET_CHECK_ENABLED`    | boolean | `false` | Enables budget limit checking for LLM proxy requests                             |
| `LLM_PROXY_BUDGET_SYNC_ENABLED`     | boolean | `false` | Syncs predefined budgets from `budgets-config.yaml` into the database on startup |
| `LLM_PROXY_BUDGET_BACKFILL_ENABLED` | boolean | `false` | Backfills user budget assignments from LiteLLM on startup for existing users     |

**In Helm Values** (`values.yaml`):

```yaml
api:
  env:
    - name: LLM_PROXY_BUDGET_CHECK_ENABLED
      value: "true"
    - name: LLM_PROXY_BUDGET_SYNC_ENABLED
      value: "true"
    - name: LLM_PROXY_BUDGET_BACKFILL_ENABLED
      value: "true"
```

:::warning
`LLM_PROXY_BUDGET_SYNC_ENABLED` must be `true` for predefined budgets from `budgets-config.yaml` to be loaded into the database. Without it, budget definitions in the config file have no effect.
:::

## Customizing Budgets via Helm

To override the default budget or add category-specific budgets, mount a custom `budgets-config.yaml` using the Helm chart's `extraVolumeMounts`, `extraVolumes`, and `extraObjects` values.

:::tip
The custom `budgets-config.yaml` fully replaces the built-in default. Include all budgets you need – including the `default` platform budget – when providing a custom file.
:::

Add the following to your Helm values:

```yaml
extraVolumeMounts: |
  - name: codemie-budgets-config
    mountPath: /app/config/budgets/budgets-config.yaml
    subPath: budgets-config.yaml

extraVolumes: |
  - name: codemie-budgets-config
    configMap:
      name: codemie-budgets-config

extraObjects:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: codemie-budgets-config
    data:
      budgets-config.yaml: |
        predefined_budgets:
          - budget_id: default
            name: Default
            description: Default platform budget for new LiteLLM customers.
            soft_budget: 80.0
            max_budget: 120.0
            budget_duration: 30d
            budget_category: platform
          - budget_id: codemie_cli
            name: CodeMie CLI
            description: Budget for CodeMie CLI usage.
            soft_budget: 100.0
            max_budget: 150.0
            budget_duration: 30d
            budget_category: cli
          - budget_id: codemie_premium_models
            name: CodeMie Premium Models
            description: Budget for premium models usage.
            soft_budget: 20.0
            max_budget: 30.0
            budget_duration: 30d
            budget_category: premium_models
```

After applying the Helm values, the ConfigMap is mounted at `/app/config/budgets/budgets-config.yaml` inside the pod and picked up automatically.

## Accessing the Budgets Page in LiteLLM UI

1. Navigate to your LiteLLM Proxy UI endpoint
2. Log in with your administrative credentials
3. From the left sidebar, click on **Budgets**

![LiteLLM Budgets Page](./images/litellm-budgets.png)

## Creating a Budget in LiteLLM UI

Predefined budgets are managed via `budgets-config.yaml` (see [Customizing Budgets via Helm](#customizing-budgets-via-helm)). You can also create ad-hoc budgets directly in the LiteLLM UI for teams or projects not covered by predefined categories.

### Step 1: Open Budget Creation Form

1. On the Budgets page, click the **+ Create Budget** button in the top-left corner
2. The "Create Budget" dialog will appear

![Create Budget Dialog](./images/litellm-budgets-create.png)

### Step 2: Configure Budget Settings

Fill in the required and optional fields:

#### Budget ID (Required)

- **Field**: Budget ID
- **Description**: A human-friendly name for the budget
- **Example**: `team-alpha`, `project-x`, `integration-budget`

#### Rate Limiting (Optional)

Configure rate limits to control usage:

- **Max Tokens per Minute**: Limits the number of tokens processed per minute (default is model limit if not set)
- **Max Requests per Minute**: Limits the number of API requests per minute (default is model limit if not set)

### Step 3: Create the Budget

1. Review your configuration
2. Click the **Create Budget** button at the bottom-right of the dialog
3. Your budget will appear in the budgets list

## Premium Models Budget

For costly models such as Claude Opus, you can configure a separate budget to track and enforce spending independently from the default end-user budget. When configured, CodeMie automatically attributes premium model requests to a derived LiteLLM customer identity (`{user_email}_codemie_premium_models`), allowing you to apply stricter limits to expensive models without affecting the standard budget.

:::info Feature Toggle
This feature activates when a budget with `budget_category: premium_models` is present in `budgets-config.yaml` and `LITELLM_PREMIUM_MODELS_ALIASES` is set. If neither is configured, all requests use standard budget behavior.
:::

### Step 1: Define the Premium Models Budget

Add a `premium_models` budget entry to your `budgets-config.yaml` (via [Helm customization](#customizing-budgets-via-helm)):

```yaml
- budget_id: codemie_premium_models
  name: CodeMie Premium Models
  description: Budget for premium models usage.
  soft_budget: 20.0
  max_budget: 30.0
  budget_duration: 30d
  budget_category: premium_models
```

### Step 2: Configure Premium Model Aliases

Set the `LITELLM_PREMIUM_MODELS_ALIASES` environment variable to a JSON array of model name substrings that qualify as premium:

```bash
LITELLM_PREMIUM_MODELS_ALIASES='["opus"]'
```

**In AI/Run CodeMie Backend values** (`values.yaml`):

```yaml
extraEnv:
  - name: LITELLM_PREMIUM_MODELS_ALIASES
    value: '["opus"]'
```

To disable premium model tracking, remove the variable or set it to an empty array:

```yaml
extraEnv:
  - name: LITELLM_PREMIUM_MODELS_ALIASES
    value: '[]'
```

### How It Works

Model detection uses substring matching: a model is treated as premium if any configured alias appears as a substring of the model name (e.g., alias `"opus"` matches `"claude-opus-4"`).

When a premium model is detected:

1. CodeMie derives a separate LiteLLM customer identity: `{user_email}_codemie_premium_models` (e.g., `john@company.com_codemie_premium_models`)
2. The request is attributed to that identity for independent budget enforcement
3. LiteLLM deducts spending from the budget identified by `budget_category: premium_models` in `budgets-config.yaml` (the `codemie_premium_models` customer identity), instead of the default platform budget

When `LITELLM_PREMIUM_MODELS_ALIASES` is set to an empty array (`'[]'`), premium model detection is disabled. No premium identity is created, all spending is charged against the default platform budget, and a generic budget error is returned if that limit is exceeded.

The `/spending` endpoint returns an additional `premium_current_spending` field when this feature is enabled, so you can monitor premium model costs separately.
