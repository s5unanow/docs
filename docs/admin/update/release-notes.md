### CodeMie 2.44.0 {#v2-44-0}

<details>
<summary>Release details</summary>

**Release Date:** August 20, 2026 · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.44.0)

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

No third-party component updates in this release.

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **AWS Terraform changes**
   - **S3 user data bucket encryption switched to SSE-KMS** — the user data S3 bucket is now encrypted with a dedicated customer-managed KMS key instead of SSE-S3 (`AES256`). This change only applies to objects uploaded after the update; existing objects keep their current encryption and remain fully readable. To re-encrypt existing files with the new key:
     1. Run:
        ```bash
        aws s3 cp s3://<AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME>/ s3://<AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME>/ --recursive
        ```
   - **RDS PostgreSQL now uses IAM database authentication** — `codemie-api` on AWS connects to the RDS PostgreSQL instance using short-lived IAM authentication tokens instead of a static password. Existing deployments must be migrated — see [Upgrading an Existing Deployment to IAM Authentication](../deployment/aws/kubernetes/components-deployment/manual-deployment/data-layer.md#upgrading-an-existing-deployment-to-iam-authentication).

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

No third-party component updates in this release.

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **Container image registry path updated in `codemie-helm-charts` values files** — the default container image repository has changed from `prod` to `codemie-clients-releases` in the Helm chart values.

   Affected charts: `codemie`, `codemie-ui`, `codemie-nats-auth-callout`, `codemie-mcp-connect-service`, `mermaid-server`.

   :::warning
   All existing releases are available in both repositories, and future releases will continue to be published to both. Therefore, no immediate action is required. However, we recommend updating any custom `values.yaml` overrides that reference `prod` to use `codemie-clients-releases` instead.

<details>
<summary>Release details</summary>

**Release Date:** July 9, 2026 · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.38.0)

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

No third-party component updates in this release.

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **Google OAuth credentials required for Google Docs datasources** — Google Docs indexing now authenticates via per-user Google OAuth instead of a shared service account. Three new environment variables must be set before Google Docs datasources can be created:

   | Variable                     | Description                                                                                                                                 |
   | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`     | OAuth 2.0 Client ID from Google Cloud Console                                                                                               |
   | `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth 2.0 Client Secret from Google Cloud Console                                                                                           |
   | `CALLBACK_API_BASE_URL`      | Public HTTPS hostname of your deployment (defaults to `http://host.docker.internal:8080` — must be overridden in all non-local deployments) |

   See [Google OAuth](../configuration/codemie/api-configuration.md#google-oauth) in the API Configuration guide for the full Google Cloud Console setup steps. See also [Add and Index Google Data Source](../../user-guide/data-source/datasources-types/add-google-data-source.md) for datasource setup instructions.

   :::warning Action required
   Existing Google Docs datasources that relied on the service account sharing approach will need to be updated.
   :::

2. **Code Executor is disabled by default** — set `CODE_EXECUTOR_ENABLED=true` to opt in; while disabled, the tool is neither listed in the tools catalog nor executed.
3. **`AUTHORIZED_APPS_ALLOWED_KEY_DOMAINS` required for Authorized Applications** — set it to the list of domains allowed to host `public_key_url` keys before relying on your Authorized Applications configuration. Requests referencing a `public_key_url` on a domain not in the allowlist are rejected.

<h3>Other Improvements</h3>

This release also delivers a set of security and hardening improvements across the CodeMie platform.

- Removed the local mode of Code Executor; the sandboxed Code Executor tool is now disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled via `CODE_EXECUTOR_ENABLED`.
- Hardened Authorized Applications by validating `public_key_url` domains against an explicit allowlist (`AUTHORIZED_APPS_ALLOWED_KEY_DOMAINS`).

### CodeMie 2.37.0 {#v2-37-0}

<details>
<summary>Release details</summary>

**Release Date:** July 2, 2026 · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.37.0)

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

No third-party component updates in this release.

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

No breaking configuration changes were introduced in this release.

<h3>Other Improvements</h3>

This release also delivers a set of security and hardening improvements across the CodeMie platform, its infrastructure, and supporting services.

<h4>Code Execution &amp; Tooling Security</h4>

- Deprecated the legacy Python tool in favor of the sandboxed CodeExecutor tool.
- Hardened the Code Executor by closing security-policy and threshold bypass paths and strengthening execution isolation.
- Reduced arbitrary code-execution risk in MCP server configuration and added corresponding security validation.
- Mitigated remote code-execution risks in workspace script execution and MCP tools.
- Hardened the internal MCP-Connect service bridge.

<h4>Authentication, Authorization &amp; Access Control</h4>

- Revised legacy header-based authentication logic and removed an redundant authentication header.
- Reviewed AWS IAM trust policies for service accounts and hardened cloud IAM configurations, including role-chaining and access-scope reductions.

<h4>Platform &amp; Dependency Maintenance</h4>

- Upgraded multiple platform components and dependencies (logging, search, networking, storage drivers, and security sensors) to address known CVEs, including a kernel-level fix.
- Reviewed and reduced exposure of internal code-execution endpoints.

<h4>AWS Infrastructure</h4>

- Reviewed and tightened cluster API access, IMDS access, and authentication tokens.
- Improved project configuration security, enabled default fault-tolerance and monitoring for the managed database, and enabled versioning for user-data storage.
- Disabled EKS Auto Mode IAM policy for cluster role.
- Revised IAM policies permissions and improved observability and encryption for the EKS cluster.
- Enabled reuse of an existing VPC / subnets and enabled enforcement of network policies for the VPC CNI.
- Removed EKS SSH key pair creation and usage.

### CodeMie 2.36.0 {#v2-36-0}

<details>
<summary>Release details</summary>

**Release Date:** June 26, 2026 · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.36.0)

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

No third-party component updates in this release.

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **AWS Terraform changes**
   - **IMDS hop limit reduced to 1** — prevents containers from accessing the instance metadata service.
   - **S3 user data bucket versioning enabled** — the user data S3 bucket now has versioning enabled, protecting against accidental deletion and overwrites. Noncurrent object versions are automatically expired after 365 days.
   - **`AmazonBedrockFullAccess` replaced with a custom IAM policy** — the broad AWS-managed policy is replaced with a least-privilege custom policy scoped to Anthropic, Amazon Titan, Qwen, and Moonshot AI models, including cross-region inference profiles for all supported prefixes (`us`, `eu`, `ap`, `global`, `jp`, `au`).

<h3>Hotfixes</h3>

- **2.36.1** · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.36.1) – June 29, 2026

### CodeMie 2.35.0 {#v2-35-0}

<details>
<summary>Release details</summary>

**Release Date:** June 22, 2026 · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.35.0)

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

No third-party component updates in this release.

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **`security.processAuthSecret` removed from AI/Run CodeMie Backend Helm chart** — the static shared-secret approach for inter-process authentication (`INTERNAL_BIND_KEY`) has been replaced with per-request HMAC signing. The key is now generated in-memory at pod startup and no Kubernetes Secret is needed.

   :::tip Configuration housekeeping
   If the **AI/Run CodeMie Backend** Helm chart values still contain `security.processAuthSecret`, it can be safely removed:

   ```yaml
   # Remove the following block from your custom Helm values:
   security:
     processAuthSecret:
       create: false
       name: "internal-bind-key"
       field: "bind-key"
   ```

   If you created a Kubernetes Secret for `INTERNAL_BIND_KEY` manually (e.g. for ArgoRollout deployments), it can also be safely deleted.
   :::

2. **MCP Connect Service isolated to a dedicated Kubernetes namespace** — `codemie-mcp-connect-service` is now deployed in its own `codemie-mcp-connect-service` namespace with Pod Security Admission (`restricted`) enforced. This improves workload isolation and aligns with security best practices.

   :::tip Script deployments
   The provided deployment script handles namespace creation, Pod Security Admission labeling, and service deployment automatically. No manual action is required.
   :::

   :::note Manual migration (without deployment script)
   To apply the same isolation manually:
   1. Create the namespace and apply Pod Security Admission labels:

      ```bash
      kubectl create namespace codemie-mcp-connect-service
      kubectl label namespace codemie-mcp-connect-service \
        pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted \
        pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version=latest \
        --overwrite
      ```

   2. Redeploy the Helm chart into the new namespace and update `MCP_CONNECT_URL` in the **AI/Run CodeMie Backend** Helm values:

      ```yaml
      - name: MCP_CONNECT_URL
        value: "http://codemie-mcp-connect-service-{MCP_CONNECT_BUCKET}.codemie-mcp-connect-service-headless.codemie-mcp-connect-service:3000"
      ```

   3. Delete the old deployment from the `codemie` namespace.
      :::

   :::tip Network isolation hardening
   Applying Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` to the `codemie-mcp-connect-service` namespace is
   recommended to enforce least-privilege traffic controls. See
   [Network Policies for MCP Connect Service](../security/network-policies/mcp-connect-service.mdx) for
   cloud-specific configurations and helper scripts.
   :::

3. **AWS Terraform changes**
   - **KMS hardening** — replaced the account-root `kms:*` wildcard with least-privilege policies. Key administrators now have management permissions only, and the IRSA role has cryptographic operations only. The KMS IAM policy scope is narrowed to the specific key. Review KMS-dependent workloads for access regressions after upgrading.
   - **Multi-AZ enabled by default for all RDS instances** — all RDS instances (main CodeMie, Keycloak, LiteLLM, Langfuse) now run with a standby replica in a secondary Availability Zone, providing automatic failover in case of an AZ outage. The change is applied during the next scheduled RDS maintenance window.
   - **Network Policy enforcement enabled for the AWS VPC CNI addon.**

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

<h4>Keycloak Operator 1.34.0</h4>

keycloak-operator has been updated from 1.32.0 to 1.34.0 (Helm chart 1.32.0 to 1.34.0). For details, see the [keycloak-operator 1.34.0 Release Notes ↗](https://github.com/epam/edp-keycloak-operator/releases/tag/v1.34.0).

Starting from v1.33.0, keycloak-operator no longer auto-appends the `/auth` context path. If your Keycloak is deployed with a context path (e.g. `/auth`), include it explicitly in `keycloak.url` in your `oauth2-proxy` Helm chart values (e.g. `http://keycloakx-http/auth`). If Keycloak runs without a context path, leave the URL as-is.

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **`opsPool` removed from AI/Run CodeMie Backend Helm chart** - this workload was deprecated and is no longer supported. Remove all `opsPool.*` fields from the custom Helm values before upgrading.

   :::tip Configuration housekeeping
   If the **AI/Run CodeMie Backend** Helm chart values still contain `opsPool`, it can be safely removed.

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **[BREAKING]** Ingress annotations removed from upstream Helm charts

   :::danger Breaking Change
   These annotations are no longer shipped as defaults in the Helm charts but are still required for oauth2-proxy authentication to work. Add them to the custom Helm values before upgrading to preserve this behavior.
   :::

   The following oauth2-proxy ingress annotations announced for removal in 2.28.0 have been removed from the default values of the **AI/Run CodeMie Backend** and **AI/Run CodeMie UI** Helm charts:

   ```yaml
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-response-headers: X-Auth-Request-Access-Token,Authorization
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: https://$host/oauth2/start?rd=$escaped_request_uri

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **`viteEnableAnalytics` removed from AI/Run CodeMie UI Helm chart** — this value and the corresponding `VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS` environment variable were deprecated and are no longer supported.

   :::tip Configuration housekeeping
   If the `AI/Run CodeMie UI` Helm chart values still contain `viteEnableAnalytics`, it can be safely removed.
   :::

2. **Infrastructure logs index renamed** — the default value of `ELASTIC_LOGS_INDEX` changed from `codemie_infra_logs*` to `logs-codemie-infra*`. If this value is set explicitly in the deployment, update it accordingly. See [Logs Retention](../configuration/observability/logs-retention.md) for cleanup and retention configuration.

2. **Post-migration cleanup** — if the Platform-Managed Mode migration has been completed but the one-time migration variables have not yet been removed, this is a good time to clean them up.

   :::tip Post-migration housekeeping
   After a successful migration, the following variables are no longer needed and should be removed from `extraEnv`:
   - `KEYCLOAK_MIGRATION_ENABLED`
   - `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_URL`

<summary>Release details</summary>

**Release Date:** April 23, 2026 · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.24.0)

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

<h4>LiteLLM 1.83.7 (CodeMie 2.24.1)</h4>

Updated from 1.81.0. For details, see the [LiteLLM 1.83.7 Release Notes ↗](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/releases/tag/v1.83.7-stable).

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

1. **[BREAKING]** Fluent Bit: Remove `span_id` and `trace_id` from Metrics Logs

   :::danger Breaking Change
   Without this configuration update, **no metrics will be written** to the `codemie_metrics_logs` Elasticsearch index. Apply this change before or during the upgrade to CodeMie 2.24.0.
   :::

   A new `[FILTER]` block must be added to `fluent-bit/values.yaml` to strip `span_id` and `trace_id` fields from CodeMie metrics logs before they are forwarded to Elasticsearch.

   **Why:** Starting with CodeMie 2.24.0, the backend includes `span_id` and `trace_id` fields in its log output. These fields are not accepted by the `codemie_metrics_logs` Elasticsearch index, causing all metrics ingestion to fail.

   **Required change in `fluent-bit/values.yaml`:**

   ```ini
   [FILTER]
       Name         record_modifier
       Match        kube.codemie-metrics.*
       Remove_key   span_id
       Remove_key   trace_id
   ```

   This filter is included in the updated `codemie-helm-charts`. No manual action is required if you are upgrading using the provided Helm charts.

2. **Keycloak Login Theme**

   The CodeMie login theme (`codemie`) is now automatically applied to the `codemie-prod` realm via the `oauth2-proxy` Helm chart.

   **Upgrade instructions:** [Keycloak Theme Setup](./keycloak/keycloak-theme-setup.md)

3. **New Environment Variable:** `INTERNAL_BIND_KEY`

   A new `INTERNAL_BIND_KEY` environment variable has been introduced.
   It is a shared secret for inter-process communication.
   Without it, webhook trigger may fail when running multiple workers (`WORKERS > 1`) or multiple pod replicas.

   **If upgrading using Helm charts:**

   The updated Helm chart automatically creates a Kubernetes Secret with a random value for `INTERNAL_BIND_KEY`.
   No manual action is required for standard deployments.

   :::warning ArgoRollout deployments
   Automatic secret generation is skipped when `argoRollout` is enabled.
   Create the Kubernetes Secret manually and reference it via `security.processAuthSecret.name` and `security.processAuthSecret.field`.
   :::

   **If deploying without Helm charts:**

   Set `INTERNAL_BIND_KEY` to the same strong random value across all workers and pods.
   Generate with: `openssl rand -hex 32`. Store in a secrets manager or Kubernetes Secret.

   See [API Configuration](../configuration/codemie/api-configuration.md) for full details.

<h3>Configuration Changes</h3>

#### Budget Enforcement Environment Variables

Three new environment variables have been introduced to control LLM budget enforcement. All default to `false` (disabled):

| Variable                            | Default | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LLM_PROXY_BUDGET_CHECK_ENABLED`    | `false` | Enables budget limit checking for LLM proxy requests                             |
| `LLM_PROXY_BUDGET_SYNC_ENABLED`     | `false` | Syncs predefined budgets from `budgets-config.yaml` into the database on startup |
| `LLM_PROXY_BUDGET_BACKFILL_ENABLED` | `false` | Backfills user budget assignments from LiteLLM on startup for existing users     |

See [Budget Configuration](../configuration/extensions/litellm-proxy/budget-configuration.md) and [API Configuration](../configuration/codemie/api-configuration.md) for details.

#### Deprecated Budget Environment Variables

The following environment variables are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Replace them with the corresponding `budgets-config.yaml` fields:

| Deprecated Variable                  | Type   | Default     | Replacement in `budgets-config.yaml` |

| `DEFAULT_BUDGET_ID`                  | string | `"default"` | `budget_id`                          |
| `LITELLM_PREMIUM_MODELS_BUDGET_NAME` | string | `""`        | `premium_models` category entry      |
| `LITELLM_CLI_BUDGET_NAME`            | string | `""`        | `cli` category entry                 |

See [Budget Configuration](../configuration/extensions/litellm-proxy/budget-configuration.md) for migration details.

<summary>Release details</summary>

**Release Date:** March 27, 2026 · [GitHub Tag ↗](https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie/releases/tag/2.19.0)

<h3>Third-Party Component Updates</h3>

<h4>Postgres Operator Removed</h4>

CodeMie 2.19.0 removes the `postgres-operator` Helm chart (PGO 5.4.3) used for Keycloak's in-cluster PostgreSQL. It is replaced by two new database options:

- **Dedicated database instance** — a separate, Terraform-provisioned database instance for Keycloak (default for Terraform deployments)
- **Shared CodeMie database** — Keycloak reuses the existing CodeMie database instance; a Helm hook Job automatically creates the required database and user on first install

See the [Keycloak Database Migration Guide](./keycloak/database-migration.md) for upgrade instructions.

:::note
Migration to an external database is optional. If you prefer to continue using the in-cluster PostgreSQL, no migration is required when upgrading to 2.19.0.
